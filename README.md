- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel Ángel Gallart (@Nethums).
- 👀 I’m interested in all related to web pages. I think it is the present and the future for any technology in our society.
- 🌱 I am a second year DAW student at IES Abastos (Valencia).
- 📫 How to reach me through... well, i'll contact you :)

This is my first document in the repository and I don't know much about GitHub, but that will change soon. I hope to make GitHub one of my daily tools.

See you soon!
